# CS301FinalProject
This is the website I created for my final project in Agile Info System Engineering. I used PHP, HTML, and CSS and edited the code with VisualStudio Code. The goal of the project was for students to demonstrate their understanding of the stages of information systems engineering, through the production of a prototype of a small-scale, database-oriented information system solution. I was asked to, using a scenario of my choosing, produce a prototype of a small-scale database-orientated information system solution. I decided to create a system for a fictional dental clinic that was moving from one location to four and needed a database to keep track of the offices, the dentists at each office, and the services provided by the dentists at each office. I also added a system that created appointments for customers with specific dentists. All photos are free use under Pixabay.
